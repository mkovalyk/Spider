Questions:
	- When to close the BufferedOutputStream?
	- Logging from different threads? How ouputStream will behave?
	-  
1. Tests
	- Invoke log.d from different thread
	- stress testing.
2. set log level at runtime can cause information leak.
3. Copying log files 
4. Logger internals:
	- Sleeping and waking up 
	- Limiting
5. Use DB? Abstracts from Storage?
	
	
	
Issues:
	- Thread, running for some time before got killed
	- Potential information leak
	- Log.d() can not be removed from bytecode

Ideas:
    1. Use queue of already logged models to prevent redundant creation of the models.
    2. Use handler to wake up thread, go to sleep?
    3. set log level
    4. Add copying feature
    5. Add log manager to manage logs
    6. Use internal app's storage by default.
