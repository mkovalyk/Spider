Questions:
	- When to close the BufferedOutputStream?
	- Logging from different threads?

1. Tests
	- Invoke log.d from different thread
	- stress testing.
2. set log level at runtime can cause information leak - problem of end-users..
3. Copying log files 
4. Use DB? Abstracts from Storage?
6. When to quit()?

Issues:
	- Log.d() can not be removed by proguard

Ideas:
    1. Use queue of already logged models to prevent redundant creation of the models - impossible
       according to current implementation.
   +2. Use handler to wake up thread, go to sleep?
   +3. set log level - only in constructor to prevent unexpected error during logging.
    4. Add copying feature
    5. Add log manager to manage logs - ContentProvider
    6. Use internal app's storage by default.
    7. Room database.
